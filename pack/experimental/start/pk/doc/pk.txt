*pk.txt*    The Stupid Vim plugin manager for Git submodules
==============================================================================

DESCRIPTION

    pk.vim is a minimal Vim plugin manager that doesn't care about anything
    except for useing Git submodules to manage plugins. It is specifically
    designed for users managing their Vim setup in the `~/.vim` directory.

    It uses Vim's `pack/` directory for seamless integration.

INSTALLATION

    Currently pk.vim is only available in my vimrc, maybe I'll split it into
    it's own repo later so that it can be managed by git submodules, too.

    Once the files are in place in `~/.vim/pack` Put this in your vimrc and it
    "just works":

        packloadall " load plugins
        silent! helptags ALL " import helptags for plugins

COMMANDS
    *:PkAdd*
        Usage: :PkAdd {git_repo} [pack_directory]
        Adds a Git submodule for a Vim plugin.
        - {git_repo}: The URL of the Git repository to add.
        - [pack_directory]: Optional. The pack directory ('start' or 'opt').

    *:PkRemove*
        Usage: :PkRemove {plugin_path}
        Removes a plugin and deinitializes its Git submodule.

    *:PkUpdate*
        Updates all Git submodules for all plugins.
