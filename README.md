My New Vim Configs (wip)

- intended for use with Vim 8
- intended to be loaded as git submodule in my dotfiles repo
- include `pk` script to ease git submodule usage


# Installation

run `./pk update` to initialize and update all plugin submodules



# DISCLAIMER:

My this is setup the way I like it, for now, but will likely change whenever I
feel like it. Use it at the risk of **Pandajail** where pandas are sent when
you use someone else's `vimrc`. Don't be the vimmer responsible for this:
