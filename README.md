My New Vim Configs (wip)

- intended for use with Vim 8
- intended to be loaded as git submodule in my dotfiles repo
- include `pk` script to ease git submodule usage


# Installation

run `./pk update` to initialize and update all plugin submodules

# NOTICE:

This branch is pretty much just to keep `pk` kinda fresh somewhere -- the vim plugin side is an experiment, and it's probably a little janky -- but I've decided to go back to vim-plug instead of toying with this, also because it's an easy way to install fzf and integrate it with vim, and I'm going to do that next...

anywho, check out [pack/experimental/start/pk/README.md](pack/experimental/start/pk/README.md)



# DISCLAIMER:

My this is setup the way I like it, for now, but will likely change whenever I
feel like it. Use it at the risk of **Pandajail** where pandas are sent when
you use someone else's `vimrc`. Don't be the vimmer responsible for this:
