This is being archived in favor of [https://tildegit.org/kirch/vim](https://tildegit.org/kirch/vim)
because my dotfiles want to be free and in the wild, and also I don't think I'm going to be using `pk` anymore,
I'm going back to [`junegunn/vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and using Vim 9+

we now return you to your previously scheduled README.md:

# My New Vim Configs (wip)

- intended for use with Vim 8
- intended to be loaded as git submodule in my dotfiles repo
- include `pk` script to ease git submodule usage


# Installation

run `./pk update` to initialize and update all plugin submodules



# DISCLAIMER:

My this is setup the way I like it, for now, but will likely change whenever I
feel like it. Use it at the risk of **Pandajail** where pandas are sent when
you use someone else's `vimrc`. Don't be the vimmer responsible for this:
